                <h2>A Brief History of Malware.</h2>
                <p>
                Early forms of malware often spread to computers through floppy disks that were traded between people. The first type of virus known was known as the “Creeper Worm”
                , created by BBN Technologies’ Bob Thomas, who was experimenting with self-replicating programs. These worms would display a message that said <i>“I’m the creeper,
                catch me if you can!”</i> 
                </p>
                <p>Early forms of malware were often harmless and benign, but over the course of years, these messages evolved into a more sinister industry. In the 2000s, 
                these viruses had become more malicious, and spread much quicker. SQL injections became a large potential problem, and corporations, e.g. IKEA, had become 
                victims to these malicious attacks.
