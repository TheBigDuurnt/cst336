                <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
                <p>
                Malware is shortened term used for <i>malicious software.</i> Any
                software that is created for ill intent and is meant harm against
                user devices, data, or persons, is consisdered malware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In regards to Malware, if you have ever heard the terms,
                    Virus, Spyware, Trojans, Adware, Ransomware, etc, these are
                    other forms of malware that exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the original forms of malware were used as jokes,
                    pranks, or experiments, but overtime, malware is used and
                    created for the sake of profit. A few examples would be
                    intrusive advertisments, stealing of personal and private
                    information, and spam.
